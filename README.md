# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview of Project

With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you’ll use the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Deliverables:
1. ***Deliverable 1:*** Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
2. ***Deliverable 2:*** Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
3. ***Deliverable 3:*** Optimize the Model
4. ***Deliverable 4:*** A Written Report on the Analysis

## Resources:
This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables and a proposal for further statistical study. You’ll submit the following:

* Data Source: `charity_data.csv`, `AlphabetSoupCharity.h5` and `AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimzation.h5` 
* Data Tools:  `AlphabetSoupCharity_starter_code.ipynb`, `AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb` and `AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimzation.ipynb`.
* Software: `Python 3.9`, `Visual Studio Code 1.50.0`, `Anaconda 4.8.5`, `Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4` and `Pandas`

# Deliverable 1:  
## Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model


# Deliverable 2:  
## Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model 


# Deliverable 3:  
## Optimize the Model

## DELIVERABLE RESULTS:

#### Data Preprocessing
For this analysis and model, the target is held in IS_SUCCESSFUL field.

##### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

**Model Configuration:**

* hidden_nodes_layer1 = 80
* hidden_nodes_layer2 = 30
* number_input_features = 43


##### This model acheived 63.8% accuracy with several attempts to incraese the accuracy including:

* Increasing the number of hidden nodes in layer 1 (3 X number of input features)
* Increasing the number of hidden layers to include a 3rd
* Changing the activation functions: tried linear, tanh, sigmoid for a combination of hidden layers and output layer


### SUMMARY

Our Analysis and Deep Learning Model Results include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification and results.
